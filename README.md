# AI React Studio

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It serves as a web-based IDE where you can interact with an AI coding assistant named Sasha to build and modify a React application in real-time.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Chat**: Interact with Sasha, an AI assistant specialized in React development.
- **Live IDE**: A file explorer and code editor to see your project's structure and content.
- **Code Generation**: Ask Sasha to create components, add features, or write styles. She will generate the code in the chat.
- **Apply Changes**: Explicitly tell Sasha to apply her generated code to the files in the IDE.
- **Project Download**: Download your entire React project as a `.zip` file at any time to continue development locally in VS Code or another editor.
- **File Uploads**: Upload UI mockups, JSON specifications, or even error logs to have Sasha work with them.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: A comfortable UI for any time of day.
- **Persistent Chat**: Your conversation with Sasha is saved, so you won't lose your progress if you refresh the page.
